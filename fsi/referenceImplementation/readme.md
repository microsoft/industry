FSI Landing Zones on Microsoft Azure reference implementation provides prescriptive guidance coupled with Azure best practices for the financial services industry, and it follows 5 design principles across the 8 critical design areas for organizations to define their target state for their Azure architecture.

>Note: To read and learn about the design principles and the critical design araes, please visit this [article](../../foundations/azure/README.md).

The reference architecture is modular by design and allows organizations of any size in the financial services industry to start with the optimized landing zones that support their banking worloads, and application portfolios.

In particular, it enables the organizations to start as small as needed and scale alongside their business requirements regardless of scale point.

## What is FSI Landing Zones on Microsoft Azure reference implementation?

The FSI Landing Zones reference implementation is an optimized, proven, authoritative, and roadmap aligned architecture that enables the financial services industry to deploy mission-critical, secure-by-default workloads in Azure at scale.

The reference implementation ties together all the Azure platform primitives and creates a proven, well-defined Azure architecture based on a multi-subscription design, leveraging native platform capabilities to simplify the operations of the platform as well as the landing zones containing the workloads.

## Pricing

There’s no cost associated with the reference implementation itself, as it is just an architecture that is constructed using existing Azure products and services. Therefore you only pay for the Azure products and services that you choose to enable, and also the products and services your organization will deploy into the landing zones for your workloads.

For example, you don’t pay for the Management Groups or the Azure Policies that are being assigned, but assigning a policy to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud (previously known as Azure Security Center Standard) on all landing zone subscriptions will generate cost on those subscriptions for the Microsoft Defender for Cloud service as detailed [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-defender/).

## What if I already have an existing Azure footprint?

FSI Landing Zones reference implementation will meet the organizations in the financial services industry where they are, and the design has catered for existing subscriptions and workloads in Azure.

See the following [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/transition) to learn more how you can transition into an Azure architecture based on a multi-subscription design with clear separation of platform and landing zones, such as FSI Landing Zones on Microsoft Azure.

## How FSI Landing Zones reference implementation works

This section describes at a high level how FSI Landing Zones reference implementation works. Your landing zones are the output of a multi-subscription environment for all your Azure services, where compliance, guardrails, security, networking, and identity is provided at scale by the platform.

## FSI Landing Zones architecture

The Management Group structure implemented with FSI Landing Zones is as follows:

- **Top-level Management Group** (directly under the tenant root group) is created with a prefix provided by the organization, which purposely will avoid the usage of the root group to allow organizations to move existing Azure subscriptions into the hierarchy, and also enables future scenarios. This Management Group is parent to all the other Management Groups created by FSI Landing Zones

- **Platform:** This Management Group contains all the *platform* child Management Groups, such as Management, Connectivity, and Identity. Common Azure Policies for the entire platform is assigned at this level

 - **Management:** This Management Group contains the dedicated subscription for management, monitoring, and security, which will host Azure Log Analytics, Azure Automation, Azure Storage Account for NSG Flow Logs, and Microsoft Sentinel. Specific Azure policies are assigned to harden and manage the resources in the management subscription.

 - **Connectivity:** This Management Group contains the dedicated subscription for connectivity for Azure platform and Distributed Edge, which will host the Azure networking resources required for the platform, such as Azure Virtual WAN/Virtual Network for the hub, Azure Firewall, DNS Private Zones, Express Route circuits, ExpressRoute/VPN Gateways etc among others. Specific Azure policies are assigned to harden and manage the resources in the connectivity subscription. For typical scale-out scenarios for the FSI industry, additional connectivity subscriptions can be added and brought to compliant state in an autonomous fashion due to the policy driven guardrails design principle.

 - **Identity:** This Management Group contains the dedicated subscription for identity, which is a placeholder for Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) VMs, or Azure Active Directory Domain Services to enable AuthN/AuthZ for workloads within the landing zones. Specific Azure policies are assigned to harden and manage the resources in the identity subscription.

- **Landing Zones:** This is the parent Management Group for all the landing zone subscriptions and will have workload agnostic Azure Policies assigned to ensure workloads are secure and compliant.

 - **** This is the dedicated Management Group for landing zones, which are optimized and governed aligned with migration scenarios, net-new development using PaaS services, as well as mission-critical banking workloads. An application team request as many subscriptions as they want into the various landing zones, and will be responsible for development, testing, and production. From a platform perspective, each subscription is treated equally (i.e., everything is treated as production) to reduce friction in deployment, operations, and overall continious compliance.

 - **Online:** This is the dedicated Management Group for Online landing zones, meaning workloads that may require direct internet inbound/outbound connectivity or also for workloads that may not require a VNet.

 - **Corp:** This is the dedicated Management Group for Corp landing zones, meaning workloads that requires connectivity/hybrid connectivity with the corporate network thru the hub in the connectivity subscription.

- **Mission-Critical** For mission-critical banking workloads, (e.g., payment gateways) it is recommended to deploy and operationalize these into dedicated landing zones where guardrails are in place to prevent misconfiguration that relates to reliability, resilliency, and overall performance. These landing zones must be separated from corp and online due to the nature and characteristics of the workloads, data classicfication, and strict requirement of certain SKUs for Azure services to meet the required SLAs and SLOs.

- **Playground:** This is the dedicated Management Group for subscriptions that will solely be used for testing and exploration by anyone in the organization that want to explore Azure services. These subscriptions will be securely disconnected from everything else within the tenant by Azure policies, be subject to an budget and cost enforcement, and is not meant to provide a path from test, dev, or production.
- **Decommissioned:** This is the dedicated Management Group for landing zones that are being cancelled, which then will be moved to this Management Group before deleted by Azure after 30-60 days.

## What happens when you deploy FSI Landing Zones reference implementation?

By default, all recommended settings and resources recommendations are enabled and deployed, and you must explicitly disable them if you don't want them to be deployed and configured. These resources and configurations include:

- A scalable Management Group hierarchy aligned to core platform capabilities, allowing you to operationalize at scale using centrally managed Azure RBAC and Azure Policy where platform and workloads have clear separation.

- Azure Policies that will enable autonomy for the platform and the landing zones.
- An Azure subscription dedicated for **Security, Governance, and Compliance**, which enables core platform capabilities at scale using Azure Policy such as:

 - A Log Analytics workspace and an Automation account
 - Microsoft Sentinel
 - Microsoft Defender for Cloud
 - Storage Account for the NSG Flow Logs setup
 - Diagnostics settings for Activity Logs, VMs, and PaaS resources sent to Log Analytics

- An Azure subscription dedicated for **Connectivity** for Azure platform networking and distributed edge, which deploys core Azure networking resources such as:

 - A hub virtual network

- (Optionally) An Azure subscription dedicated for **Identity** in case your organization requires to have Active Directory Domain Controllers to provide authorization and authentication for workloads deployed into the landing zones.

- Landing Zone Management Group for **** , mission-critical applications that has unique requirements for availability, performance, connectivity, latency, reliability, and security.
 - This is where you will create your subscriptions that will host your workloads.

- Landing Zone Management Group for **Corp** connected applications that require connectivity to on-premises, to other landing zones or to the internet via shared services provided in the hub virtual network.
 - This is where you will create your subscriptions that will host your corp-connected workloads.

- Landing Zone Management Group for **Online** applications that will be internet-facing, where a virtual network is optional and hybrid connectivity is not required.
 - This is where you will create your Subscriptions that will host your online workloads.

- Landing zone subscriptions for Azure native, internet-facing **Online** applications and resources.

- Landing zone subscriptions for **** , mission-critical applications and resources.
- Azure Policies for online and corp-connected landing zones, which include:
 - Enforce highly-available Public IP addresses
 - Enforce highly-available ExpressRoute gateways

- Landing zone subscriptions for **Corp** connected applications and resources, including a virtual network that will be connected to the hub via VNet peering.
- Azure Policies for online and corp-connected landing zones, which include:
 - Enforce VM monitoring (Windows & Linux)
 - Enforce VMSS monitoring (Windows & Linux)
 - Enforce Azure Arc VM monitoring (Windows & Linux)

 - Ensure subnets are associated with Network Security Groups
 - Ensure subnets are associated with User-Defined routes

## Deployment instructions

This section will describe how to deploy FSI Landing Zones reference implementation with traditional "hub and spoke" networking topology in Azure connected to the Distributed Edge and to on-premises datacenters and branch offices.

### Pre-requisites

Since FSI Landing Zones is a complete, end-to-end setup of your Azure tenant as a whole, the user making the deployment requires the "Owner" permission at the Azure tenant root scope. The following instructions explains how a Global Admin in the Azure Active Directory can elevate himself/herself - or others to have the required permissions prior to starting the deployment.

>Note: Both the role assignment as well as the deployment is a one-off exercise, and post deployment you can remove the role assignment from the tenant root scope in Azure.

The pre-requisites requires the following:

- A user that is Global Admin in the Azure Active Directory where FSI Landing Zones will be deployed.
- Elevation of privileges of a Global Admin that will grant him/her the "User Access Administrator" role assignment at the tenant root scope.
- An explicit role assignment (Azure RBAC) made at the tenant root scope via Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell (Note: There's currently no graphical user interface to make this role assignment).

#### Elevate Access to manage Azure resources in the directory

1.1 Sign into the Azure portal as the user being Global Admin.

1.2 Open Azure Active Directory.

1.3 Under 'Manage', select 'Properties'.

![properties](./media/properties.PNG)

1.4 Under 'Access management for Azure resources' set the toggle to *Yes.

![elevate](./media/elevate.PNG)

Grant explicit access to the User at the tenant root scope ("/") to deploy FSI Landing Zones

You can use either Bash (Azure CLI) or PowerShell (Az.Resources) to create the role assignment for user that will do the deployment.

Bash:

```bash
#sign into AZ CLI, this will redirect you to a web browser for authentication, if required
az login

#assign Owner role to Tenant root scope ("/") as a Owner (gets object Id of the current user (az login))
az role assignment create --scope '/' --role 'Owner' --assignee-object-id $(az ad signed-in-user show --query "objectId" --output tsv)
```

Powershell:

```powershell
#sign in to Azure from Powershell, this will redirect you to a web browser for authentication, if required
Connect-AzAccount

#get object Id of the current user (that is used above)
$user = Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName (Get-AzContext).Account

#assign Owner role to Tenant root scope ("/") as a User Access Administrator
New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope '/' -RoleDefinitionName 'Owner' -ObjectId $user.Id
```

> Please note: it can take up to 15 minutes for permission to propagate at tenant root scope. It is therefore recommended that you log out and log back in to refresh the token before you proceed with the deployment.*

### Optional pre-requisites

The deployment experience in Azure portal allows you to bring in existing (preferably empty) subscriptions dedicated for the platform part of the FSI Landing Zones architecture. It also allows you to bring existing subscriptions that can be used as the initial landing zones for your carrier grade workloads.

## Step by step guidance

This section will explain the deployment experience and the options provided for FSI Landing Zones reference implementation.

When you click on [*Deploy to Microsoft Cloud*](https://aka.ms/FSIRi), it will start the deployment experience in the Azure portal into your default Azure tenant. In case you have access to multiple tenants, ensure you are selecting the right one.

### Deployment location

On the first page, select the *Region*. This region will primarily be used to place the deployment resources in an Azure region, but also used as the initial region for some of the resources that are deployed, such as Azure Monitoring resources.

![Deployment location](./media/location.PNG)

### FSI Landing Zones Architecture setup

Provide a prefix that will be used to create the management group hierarchy and platform resources, and select if you would use dedicated subscriptions or a single subscription for platform resources (please note that dedicates subscriptions are recommended, and single platform subscription is only for PoC and testing purposes). For this scenario, select **Dedicated**.

![Arch setup](./media/archsetup.PNG)

### Security, Governance, and Compliance

On the *Security, Governance, and Compliance* tab, you will configure the core infrastructure required for all-up platform observability and security, which will be enabled at scale via Azure Policy for the entire Azure architecture as well as the landing zones to ensure continuously compliance for the Azure resources. A dedicated (and empty) subscription is required to host this infrastructure, which will be separated from other platform resources, such as networking and identity that you will configure later.

![Security and governance](./media/security.PNG)

For the Microsoft Defender for Cloud settings, you must also provide an email address in order to receive critical security notifications from Microsoft Defender for Cloud service.

![Defender](./media/defender.PNG)

### Connectivity for Azure and Distributed Edge

On the *Connectivity for Azure and Distributed Edge* tab, you will configure the core networking platform resources, such as hub virtual network, gateways (VPN and/or ExpressRoute), Azure Firewall, Private DNS Zones for Azure PaaS services, and depending on the options you selected on the *Security, Governance, and Compliance* tab, additional networking security and monitoring options will be presented, such as DDoS Protection Standard, Network Watcher, NSG Flow Logs, and Traffic Analytics.

To deploy and configure a "hub and spoke" topology, you must:

- In the *Deploy networking topology for Azure and Distributed Edge* option, select either "Hub and spoke with Azure Firewall" or "Virtual VWAN (Microsoft managed). In this guidance we will select the "Hub and spoke with Azure Firewall".
- Provide a dedicated (empty) subscription that will be used to host the requisite networking infrastructure.
- Provide the address space to be assigned to the hub virtual network
- Select an Azure region where the hub virtual network will be created
- Depending on the Azure region, you can optionally use Azure Virtual Network Manager to manage your virtual networks at scale and also enable full mesh.

 ![img](./media/hubandspoke.PNG)

In addition, you can configure:

- Azure Private DNS Zones for Azure PaaS services
- VPN and ExpressRoute Gateways
 - If you choose to deploy either or both of these gateways, you will have the option to select the subnet to be dedicated for these resources, if you decide to deploy them as regional or zone-redundant gateways, as well as choose the right SKU based on your requirements
- If you choose to deploy Azure Firewall, you will have the option to
 - Select the subnet
 - Select to deploy Azure Firewall as regional or zone redundant (recommended)
 - Select the Firewall SKU (Standard or Premium). It is recommended to choose the Azure Firewall [Premium](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/premium-features) SKU if your organization requires next generation firewall capabilities such as TLS inspection or network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS).
 - Indicate if you want to enable DNS Proxy in Azure Firewall.

For Networking security and monitoring solutions:

- DDoS Protection Standard to be enabled for the Azure platform. Enabling this will provide an option to assign requisite Azure Policy on the * landing zones* tab later.
- Network Watcher observability for the virtual networks that will be created. Enabling this will assign Azure Policy to ensure that Network Watcher will be created into all subscriptions containing a virtual network.
- NSG Flow Logs can be enabled for all Network Security Groups, and will be stored into a storage account in the dedicated subscription for *Security, Governance, and Compliance* subscription, and also in the Azure Log Analytics workspace.
- Traffic Analytics which provides a curated view of networking traffic for Azure and Distributed Edge.

### Authentication & Authorization

On the *Authentication & Authorization* tab you can specify if you want to assign recommended policies to primarily secure and govern domain controllers in Azure, which will have its dedicated subscription to ensure clear separation of concerns, and to provide AuthN/AuthZ to workloads into the landing zones. You can then select which policies you want to get assigned, and you will need to provide the address space for the virtual network that will be deployed on this subscription. Please note that this virtual network will be connected to the hub virtual network via VNet peering.

If you don't need - or plan to host domain controllers in Azure for your telco workloads, you can select *No*. If you later want to add dedicated subscription for these purposes, you can move it manually to the 'identity' management group in the hierarchy created by FSI Landing Zones.

 ![img](./media/auth.PNG)

### Landing Zones

On the * Landing Zones* tab, you can bring in the subscriptions you want to use initially for **, *online*, and *corp* landing zones. Each landing zone type is represented by its own child management group of the *landing zones* management group in the hierarchy, and provides different characteristics regarding networking requirements, security, policy, and availability. For each of the landing zone types, you can select the recommended Azure policies you want to assign, as well as the policies recommended for *all* landing zone types.

- landing zones

Subscriptions can be moved into the ** management group, and bootstrapped with Azure policies that are assigned directly to this management group, as well as the overarching policies assigned to the intermediate root management group, and the landing zones management group.
The specific policies for the landing zones will - in addition to compliance and security, ensure that carrier grade workloads are configured with resiliency, performance, and availability in mind.

![lz](./media/lz.PNG)

- Corp landing zones

For workloads that require corp connectivity, and hybrid connectivity through the central connectivity subscription for the Azure platform and Distributed Edge, can be moved/created into the *corp* management group.

![corplz](./media/corplz.PNG)

- Online landing zones

For workloads that does not require corp connectivity, subscriptions can be moved/created into the *online* management group.

![onlinelz](./media/onlinelz.PNG)

- Recommended Azure policies for all landing zones

By default, every recommendation is enabled, and you must explicitly opt out if you do not want to assign the recommended policies. The list of available policies will depend on configuration made earlier in the deployment experience.

![lzpolicies](./media/lzpolicies.PNG)

### Review + create

*Review + Create* page will validate your permission and configuration before you can click deploy. Once it has been validated successfully, you can click *Create*
