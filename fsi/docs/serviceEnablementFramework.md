# Service Enablement Framework for FSI on Microsoft Azure

As business units request to put workloads into Azure, it requires additional visibility into a workload to determine how to achieve appropriate levels of Governance, Security, and Compliance. When a new service is required that has not been onboarded, allowing the service needs to occur. The following table provides a framework to assess enterprise security readiness of Azure services.
