# Microsoft Cloud Foundations for Industries

Industry solutions such as Healthcare, Retail, and Financial Services are a composition of different services, infrastructure components, and application components that are deployed into their respective Microsoft *Cloud* such as Power Platform, Azure, and Microsoft 365, to provide optmized, curated, and tailored experiences for the industry verticals.

As a recommendation, and regardless where each organization is on their journey towards leveraging industry solutions, each Microsoft Cloud need to have a well-architected *foundation* that caters for security, governance, compliance, identity and access, scale, and interoperability. This will ensure successful deployment of the industry solutions and de-risk an organization's technical debt as every cloud foundation is based on prescriptive and proven guidance, that is aligned with the overall product roadmap for the Microsoft Clouds.

A high-level overview of the architecture composition for Azure, Power Platform, and Microsoft 365 can be seen below, where each of the cloud's architecture is based on its respective "North Star" architecture and design methodology.
