This folder contains solutions for retail built using Microsoft Cloud (Azure, D365, O365, M365, Power Platform).

Goal of solutions is to provide prescriptive design recommendations and reference implementation to address key retail-specific scenarios.

The solutions covered here were created based on feedback captured from various groups working across retail engagements. We will continue adding more solutions to this list as part of industry guidance.
