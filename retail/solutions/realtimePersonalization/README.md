# Realtime Personalization

This solution enables personalized recommendations and relevant product search and it's composed of two primary building blocks:

- Intelligent Recommendations (IR) service
- D365 Marketing

The solution is leverages services and capabilities across Azure, Power Platform and Dynamics 365 to enable organizations to build, map and manage complex customer journeys.

## Deployment Components

The image below shows the composition of this solution. It has two primary building blocks:

- Dynamics365 Marketing (D365 Marketing)
- Intelligent Recommendations (IR)

### Azure Deployment

Focusing on **Azure deployment**, IR is deployed as part of [Microsoft's Cloud-Scale Analytics scenario](https://github.com/Azure/data-product-analytics) which includes a **Data Management Landing Zone** and a **Data Landing Zone**. The primary intent is to facilitate movement and storage of data at-scale. The deployment also consists of application runtime environment where customers can consume recommendations generated by IR*.

<sub>**IR* is a headless service which exposes recommendations via a set of REST APIs. These are to be consumed via an end user interface such as an application or a site. A runtime environment such as AKS or App Service Environment (ASE) enables this, and it is included as part of the deployment.</sub>

### D365 Marketing Deployment

D365 Marketing is deployed in a [Power Platform environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/environments-overview). We use [Power Platform Landing Zones](https://github.com/microsoft/industry/tree/main/foundations/powerPlatform) as foundations for deploying D365 Marketing.

> Note: Environments are sometimes also known as organizations or environments. Each of these terms refers to the same concept. The Power Apps user interface and documentation usually use the term environment, while Dynamics 365 Marketing documentation usually uses the term environment (though you'll sometimes also see the terms organization or org here). Since this guidance relies on Power Platform Admin Center functionality, it refers exclusively to environments.

[Dynamics 365 Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/marketing/overview) consists of two primary modules, along with event management. Both modules include capabilities to create graphical email and design interactive customer journeys to support marketing initiatives.

**Important Note about this deployment guidance**

- This guidance uses a single AAD tenant which is used across Azure, Power Platform etc. Please DO NOT use separate AAD tenants for end-to-end deployment of this solution.
- In context of Power Platform Environments, a solution which consists of multiple D365 apps which require access to a common Dataverse instance and other components such as Power Apps; Automate etc., we will use a a single Power Platform environment so that components belonging to an environment can be shared across application boundaries.
