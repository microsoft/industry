## IOM

Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management (IOM) is built on a modern open platform and Dataverse. It provides the flexibility companies need today to capture orders from any order source such as online e-commerce, marketplace, mobile apps, or traditional sources like EDI  and fulfill them from their own warehouse, 3PL , stores, or drop-ship with vendors or other delivery fulfillment partners.
It’s a common scenario for enterprises to have disparate systems for ecommerce, fulfillment, and shipping/delivery. IOM bridges these disparities and provides a single pane of glass to manage end to end lifecycle of an Order. [Extensibility features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/intelligent-order-management/extensibility) allow customers to integrate IOM with their existing ecosystem of applications.

The system also helps organizations streamline the return processes. Whether returns are collected at a retail store, fulfillment center, or service center, returns can be initiated through an app, online, or at the store.

With low-code, no-code experience, IOM’s orchestration designer tools allow users to model and automate the response to fulfillment constraints and leverage machine learning to influence & optimize the flow of the orders.
