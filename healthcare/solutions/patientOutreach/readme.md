# Patient outreach

Patient outreach is a patient campaign management application that helps organize and automate marketing and outreach to patients. Healthcare providers can communicate with their communities and patients in a targeted, efficient way. Providers can use email, text, regular mail, or a combination, to provide healthcare information to specific groups of patients and community members.

Key capabilities of Patient outreach include:

* **Patient segmentation**: Prebuilt patient segments to provide baseline patient cohorts.
* **Patient engagement campaigns**: Create healthcare-specific email campaigns that use prebuilt patient segments.
* **Event management**: Use provider/payor event management templates for event administration and registration.
