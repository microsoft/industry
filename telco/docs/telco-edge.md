# Distributed Edge

Telcos operate a distributed edge network to provide services (such as Radio Access Networks, RAN, or Wi-Fi) closer to where their customers are.

The Azure for Telco industry reference implementation provides prescriptive guidance to leverage the Telcoâ€™s distributed edge infrastructure to provide Azure services at the edge via [Azure Stack Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/) and [Azure private multi-access edge compute (MEC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-multi-access-edge-compute-mec/overview), which among other benefits provide a low-latency experience to users, as services are provided directly at the edge instead of having to provide the services from the Azure region. Such services typically include 5G, CDN, gaming or augmented/virtual reality.

This is depicted in figure 5 below:
