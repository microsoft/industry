# Governance for Telco Industry Scenarios

In general, any application composition can be deployed, managed and governed in Azure using existing the prescriptive guidance and architecture provided in Cloud Adoption Framework guidance. However, some applications typical for the Telco industry, such as those that provide managed services to end customers (B2C), or businesses (B2B) requires additional set of controls and governance that are different from the traditional LoB applications, and cloud native applications. Telco industry specific applications typically provide services such as Core CP, SBC, vIMS, vHSS, Thin/uCPE, SDWAN, vFW, vRouter, vLTM, CGNAT, vBNG, DDI and vRadius among others.

For example, B2B and B2C telco applications may require deploying their own ExpressRoute Gateways so they can use dedicated ExpressRoute circuits for data plane traffic, while other dedicated circuits can provide connectivity to on-premises network for control plane traffic. Another example would be applications that require public IPs in their Landing Zones.

Given these specialized requirements and to cater for scalability for Telco industry specific scenarios in landing zones, the Azure for Telco industry reference architecture recommends the creation a new Management Group dedicated to Telco industry specific applications and services. Azure policies that are designed to govern and manage those applications can be assigned to ensure Telco applications are compliant, and configured with high-availability as default at this scope and subscriptions dedicated for such applications would need to be deployed under this management group. This new management group is depicted in figure 2 below:
