## What is the Network Analytics Landing Zone for Operators reference implementation?

A Network Analytics Landing Zone for operators provides the required foundational services on Azure to ingest large amounts of data into Azure storage services (such as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2). Once this landing zone is provisioned, operators can simply deploy whichever data and analytics services and solutions they prefer to analyze the data.

The reference implementation ties together all the Azure platform primitives and creates a proven, well-defined landing zone, leveraging native platform capabilities to ensure organizations in the telecommunication industry can deploy observability workloads in Azure at scale.

---

## Pricing

Thereâ€™s no cost associated with the reference implementation itself, as it is just an architecture that is constructed using existing Azure products and services. Therefore you only pay for the Azure products and services that you choose to enable, and also the products and services your organization will deploy into the Network Analytics landing zone.

The following section will provide links to the costs of each of the services that will be deployed into your Network Analytics Landing Zone. Please note that some of the services deployed are free (for example the virtual network).

## What happens when you deploy the Network Analytics Landing Zone for Operators reference implementation?

The Network Analytics Landing Zone for Operators reference implementation will configure an Azure subscription that has been deployed (or moved under) the **Landing Zones > Operator** Management Group and deploy all required infrastructure so that you can simply deploy and configure the analytics workload of your preference. The reference implementation allows you to choose from two networking connectivity models. Depending on the network connectivy model, certain infrastructure will be deployed and configured. Figure 1 and table 1 below describes the resources that are deployed when you choose the ExpressRoute with Microsoft Peering connectivity model, while figure 2 and table 2 below describe the resources that are deployed when you choose the ExpressRoute with Private Peering connectivity model

## Deployment instructions

This section will explain the deployment experience and the options provided for the Network Analytics Landing Zone for Operators reference implementation.

[![Deploy To Microsoft Cloud](../../../../docs/deploytomicrosoftcloud.svg)](https://aka.ms/observabilitylz)

1. When you click on [Deploy to Microsoft Cloud](https://aka.ms/observabilitylz), the Azure portal will load and it will start the deployment experience into your default Azure tenant. In case you have access to multiple tenants, ensure you are selecting the right one.
2. On the **Deployment Setup** tab, select the Azure subscription that you want to use as your Network Analytics Landing Zone, and select the Azure region where the Azure resources will be deployed. Once you have made your selections, click on Next.

![Deployment_setup](../images/afo-observability-ri-setup.png)

3. On the **Network Connectivity Model** tab, specify whether your Network Analytics Landing Zone will use ExpressRoute with Microsoft Peering or Private Peering for connectivity to the on-premises network. Depending on your selection, proceed to either the ExpressRoute with Microsoft Peering or ExpressRoute with Private Peering sections.

### ExpressRoute with Microsoft Peering

1. In the **Networking Connectivity Model** tab, select **ExpressRoute with Microsoft Peering** option under **Network Connectivity Model** section.
![ExpressRoute_MSFTPeering](../images/afo-observability-ri-msft.png)
